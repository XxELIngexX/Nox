Over the past years, I've been growing in the world of software development by learning, experimenting, and building solutions that are not only functional, but designed to evolve and scale over time.",
    "philosophy": "I see software engineering as a balance between creativity and strategy. Every project starts as a blank canvas, and before writing the first line of code, I like to think about architecture, workflows, potential risks, security considerations, and user experience. For me, writing code is not just about making things work, but about making them sustainable and safe.",
