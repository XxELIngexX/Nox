    "welcome": "It's always a pleasure to have visitors, so welcome.",
    "intro": "I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a strong interest in building well-structured and reliable systems. Over the past years, I've been growing in the world of software development by learning, experimenting, and building solutions that are not only functional, but designed to evolve and scale over time.",
    "philosophy": "I see software engineering as a balance between creativity and strategy. Every project starts as a blank canvas, and before writing the first line of code, I like to think about architecture, workflows, potential risks, security considerations, and user experience. For me, writing code is not just about making things work, but about making them sustainable and safe.",
    "passion": "I enjoy understanding how systems behave, how they can fail, and how to design them better from the beginning. That curiosity is what connects my interest in development with my growing passion for cybersecurity and defensive thinking.",
    "closing": "Thanks for stopping by. If what you've seen resonates with you, I'd be glad to be part of your next project.",

    "description": "These are the tools I work with every day. I don't stick to any specific language or framework — I choose whatever fits the challenge best and push it as far as it needs to go. As a developer, I can pick up any technology because it's no longer just about writing functions; it's about understanding the logic, the flow, and how information moves through the system. Once you get that, everything else is just a matter of adaptation."
